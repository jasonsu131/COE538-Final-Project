The EEBOT guidance program coded in assembly language uses a multitude of subroutines in order to navigate through a maze. The maze consists of various turns and obstacles that the robot should be able to overcome autonomously. The first main block of code to explore is the code that controls the LCD. The LCD’s purpose is to display the battery voltage and the EEBOT’s state at all times while the maze is being navigated. To achieve this, the LCD is first cleared of any pre-existing content. After that, the battery voltage and current state are constantly displayed using a separate subroutine. The second key block of code is the state machine. The state machine is what controls the EEBOT’s actions and processes based on the current state. For example, when the bot is in the forward state and the front bumper is triggered, the bot then switches to the reverse state and does a 180° rotation into the forward state to backtrack to the last T/L junction. Another function of the bot is to return to the ALL STOP state whenever the rear bumper is triggered. The third main block of code is the guider code. This code is in charge of keeping the EEBOT centered on the black line to guide itself through the maze. Furthermore, whenever a T/L junction is met, the guider code will sense this and take the left path each time. When our code was loaded onto the EEBOT, the EEBOT was able to successfully reach the end of the maze for every trial without fail.
